  "body": "#jDateTimePlus\r\n\r\nPHP class to convert dates from Gregorian calendar system to Jalali calendar system and vice versa. Supports dates beyond 2038.  \r\nJalali, also known as Shamsi or Hijri Shamsi is the Iranian calendar system.\r\n\r\n#About this class\r\n\r\n`jDateTimePlus` 1.0.0 is based on `jDateTime` 2.2.0\r\n\r\nThis package is a fork based on jDateTime by Sallar Kaboli. In this fork, I replaced Jalali to Gregorian and vice versa methods with new ones based on jdf 2.60. Also replaced the `mktime` method with a new one because the older version gave wrong results. I also fixed some of the phpdocs and introduced new methods. This package is best used with a higher abstraction such as <a href=\"https://github.com/VSG24/EasyDateTime\">`EasyDateTime`</a>.\r\n\r\nPHP's default `date` function does not support years higher than 2038, so the `DateTime` class was introduced in PHP5 to solve this problem and provide more sophisticated date methods. Iranian users have been using an old `jdate` function to convert Gregorian date to the Jalali equivalent, which is completely based on the old php `date` function so its pretty much out-dated. \r\n\r\n#Requirements\r\n\r\nUnlike jDateTime, jDateTimePlus Requires **PHP >= 5.4**\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\n\r\n##Using Composer\r\n\r\nYou can install this package using [composer](https://getcomposer.org). Add this package to your `composer.json`:  \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"require\": {\r\n\t\"vsg24/jdatetimeplus\": \"dev-master\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor if you prefer command line, change directory to project root and:\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp composer.phar require \"vsg24/jdatetimeplus\":\"dev-master\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Manual Installation\r\n\r\nGet a copy of package source code. You can do this in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Download ZIP version of the source code and unzip it in desired location  \r\n2. Run `git clone https://github.com/VSG24/jDateTimePlus.git` to clone this repository  \r\n\r\nAfter getting a copy of source code, it is enough to include `jdatetime.class.php` where you need to use it.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nrequire_once 'path/to/source/jdatetimeplus.class.php';\r\n```\r\n\r\n#Examples\r\n\r\nPlease see [examples.php](examples.php) and [example-static.php](examples-static.php) for working examples.\r\n\r\n#Contributors:\r\n- [Vahid Amiri Motlagh](http://atvsg.com)\r\n- [Sallar Kaboli](http://sallar.me)\r\n\r\n##License\r\njDateTimePlus was created by [Vahid Amiri Motlagh](http://atvsg.com) and released under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2016 [Vahid Amiri Motlagh](http://atvsg.com)\r\n  \r\n Original Jalali to Gregorian (and vice versa) methods from \"jdf 2.60\" package:\r\n Copyright (C) 2015, Reza Gholampanahi\r\n http://jdf.scr.ir\r\n\r\n    The MIT License (MIT)\r\n    \r\n    Copyright (C) 2016 Vahid Amiri Motlagh\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\r\n    copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\r\n    to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\r\n    the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\r\n    and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\n    Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    1- The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\r\n    in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n    \r\n    2- THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\r\n    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
